# NAV home assignment

We want you to create a simple app / website that retrieves job advertisements from NAV's REST API and shows them to the user.

The ads are downloaded from NAV's website <https://arbeidsplassen.nav.no/>

Authentication is handled via a Bearer token saved as the environment variable REACT_APP_AUTH which needs to be retrieved from Nav.no (see <https://github.com/navikt/pam-public-feed#authentication> to retrieve an updated token).

## Live url: <https://nav.dfweb.no>

## Features

-   Next.js with Typescript
-   ESLint (included with Next.js by default)
-   Typography and colors used by NAV
-   Styling with SASS and modules
-   Custom responsive @mixins
-   Animations with React Transition Group and Animate.css
-   NAV frontend library implemented with multiple components like Pagination and Button
-   State management with Easy Peasy and Typescript typings
-   Responsive design
-   Saving of job ads
-   State-based API error handler with React-toastify
-   Fetched API results is saved in Redux state for easier debugging
-   Prevent duplicate jobs from being saved (shows error with React-toastify)

## Requirements

The app must meet these criteria:

-   The user should be able to see the last 10 ads when the app is opened

-   Each ad should show:

    -   dato (published)
    -   job title (jobtitle)
    -   ad title

-   The user should be able to press a button to see the next 10 ads

-   Each ad should have an "Open" button that allows the ad to show:

    -   job description (description)
    -   employer
    -   degree of extent (extent)
    -   applicationDue.

-   Each ad should have a "Save" button. Saved ads must be presented in a separate field.

-   Saved ads should not disappear even if the browser is closed and reopened.

## TODO

-   Implement "Saved ads should not disappear even if the browser is closed and reopened"
